# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I hold a M.A. in Economics and a CAS in Demography and Population Analysis. 

As a former PhD Student in Economics, I attended courses according to several doctoral programs and took part to several research projects in Microeconomics and Econometrics. I was also a member of the [ASAM Group](www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling). 

I worked as an Econometrician at the [Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO)](www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html) where I mainly contributed to the creation of an R package and to the implementation of econometric and mathematical models using *tidyverse*. 

I have been working with R since my Bachelor studies and I am passionate about the R ecosystem. I joined [cynkra GmbH](www.cynkra.com) in October 2022 as a Data Scientist.

# My professional achievements
- The R package [delfin](https://github.com/swiss-adminR/201909_slides/blob/master/2019_09_19_plc_presentation_delfin.pdf) developed with my team at the FSIO (not available in github);
- The model of the [sum of the Old-Age and Survivor's Insurance (OASI) pension amounts](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/dam/bsv/fr/dokumente/ahv/finanzperspektiven/validierung-modellansatz-ahv.pdf.download.pdf/2018_07_09_definitif_ld_rapport_ofas.pdf).

# My various research projects

<img align="right" width="350" height="300" src=sidebar_listing.jpg>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
<!--
- a research project which aims to estimate the Swiss old-age and survivor's insurance (OASI) first pension amounts as a PhD Student at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland);-->
- the clustering of the Swiss Pension Register in the R package [rrclust](https://github.com/asam-group/rrclust) using Kamila Clustering Method with the R package [kamila](https://github.com/ahfoss/kamila) of A. Foss et al. (2016) and A. Foss et al. (2018);
- testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register (e.g. R packages [forestoasi](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/forestoasi) and [rrml](https://github.com/asam-group/rrml).

# My other research topics
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing
- tools for evaluating stocks (cf. [stock-analysis repository](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/stock-analysis));
- a package for simulating the return on investment of investment projects based on several assumptions (cf. [simulreturns](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/simulreturns));
- a Shiny App for allowing to make the use of the [simulreturns](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/simulreturns) package more user-friendly (cf. [Shiny App](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/shinyreturns)).
