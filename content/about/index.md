Hello, I am Layal Christine Lettry.

I have been working as an econometrician in the Mathematics sector for the Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO) since 2017. 
On behalf of the FSIO, I have undertaken a research project in parallel with my office job as a PhD Student in Economics and Social Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Laurent Donz√© at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) and have become a member of the [ASAM Group](www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling).
