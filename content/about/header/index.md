<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I hold a M.A. in Economics and a CAS in Demography and Population Analysis. 

As a former PhD Student in Economics, I attended courses according to several doctoral programs and took part to several research projects in Microeconomics and Econometrics.

I worked as an econometrician at the [Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO)](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html) where I mainly contributed to the creation of an R package and to the implementation of econometric and mathematical models using *tidyverse*. 

Besides, I have become a member of the [ASAM Group](https://www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling) and I have worked on a research project about classification and clustering methods.

I have been working with R since my Bachelor studies and I am passionate about the R ecosystem. I joined [cynkra GmbH](https://www.cynkra.com) in October 2022 as a data scientist.
