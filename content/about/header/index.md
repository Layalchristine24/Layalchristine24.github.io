  Hi, my name is Layal. Nice to meet you.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I hold a B.A. in Management (University of Fribourg, Switzerland), an M.A. in Economics (University of Fribourg, Switzerland) and a CAS in Demography and Population Analysis (University of Geneva, Switzerland). Additionally, I have been working as a [Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)](https://bcert.me/sjmhqozmj) since November 2022.

As a former PhD Student in Economics, I attended courses according to several doctoral programs and took part in several research projects in Microeconomics and Econometrics.

Between 2017 and 2022, I worked as an econometrician at the [Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO)](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html) where I mainly contributed to the creation of an R package, namely *delfin*, and to the implementation of econometric and mathematical models using *tidyverse*. 

Besides, I have become a member of the [ASAM Group](https://www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling) and I have worked on a research project about classification and clustering methods applied to the  Swiss Pension Register (CCO/FSIO).

Finally, I have been working with R since my Bachelor's studies, and I am passionate about the R ecosystem. I joined [cynkra GmbH](https://www.cynkra.com) in October 2022 as a data scientist, working as an R consultant and contributing to the R community.

### My professional and academical achievements
- The R package [delfin](https://github.com/swiss-adminR/201909_slides/blob/master/2019_09_19_plc_presentation_delfin.pdf) developed with my team at the FSIO (not available in github);
- The model of the [sum of the Old-Age and Survivor's Insurance (OASI) pension amounts](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/dam/bsv/fr/dokumente/ahv/finanzperspektiven/validierung-modellansatz-ahv.pdf.download.pdf/2018_07_09_definitif_ld_rapport_ofas.pdf);
