<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I have been working as an econometrician in the Mathematics sector for the Federal Social Insurance Office (FSIO) since 2017. 

On behalf of the FSIO, I have undertaken a research project in parallel with my office job as a PhD Student in Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) and have become a member of the [ASAM Group](www.unifr.ch/inf/asam/en/) (Applied Statistics and Modelling).

Last but not least I love working with R !
