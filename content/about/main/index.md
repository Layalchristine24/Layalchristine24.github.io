 I am currently working on the clustering of the Swiss Pension Register using Kamila Clustering Method with the R package [kamila](https://github.com/ahfoss/kamila) of A. Foss et al. (2016) and A. Foss et al. (2018) and on classification methods. I also intend to give access to user-friendly tools to select the companies which increase the size of their dividend (cf. [divkings repository](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/divkings)). Moreover, I am working on another project in the repository named [simulreturns](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/simulreturns). Thanks to this package, it will be possible to compute the final value of some investment projects based on several assumptions by entering very few parameters. A [Shiny App](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/shinyreturns) will allow
 to make the use of the [simulreturns](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/simulreturns) package more user-friendly.
