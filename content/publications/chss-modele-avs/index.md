# Projection model of the Old-age and survivor's insurance (OASI) expenses
---

## Summary
This article documents the reasons why the OASI's expenses model has been adapted
in the spring 2018. On one hand, more transparency and rapidity in the computation
were necessary. R was the chosen solution to reach these objectives. On the 
other hand, the computation method was different for the Swiss and the foreign
population. It had to be standardised and this new programming language allowed
to do this more efficiently.
