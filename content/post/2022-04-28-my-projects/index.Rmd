Iâ€™m currently working on
<!--
- a research project which aims to estimate the Swiss old-age and survivor's insurance (OASI) first pension amounts as a PhD Student at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland);-->
- the clustering of the Swiss Pension Register in the R package [rrclust](https://github.com/asam-group/rrclust) using Kamila Clustering Method with the R package [kamila](https://github.com/ahfoss/kamila) of A. Foss et al. (2016) and A. Foss et al. (2018);
- testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register (e.g. R packages [forestoasi](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/forestoasi) and [rrml](https://github.com/asam-group/rrml).

ðŸ¤” I intend to...

- apply the [Transformation Forests](https://github.com/cran/trtf) on the Swiss Pension Register;
- develop the [Transformation Forests](https://github.com/cran/trtf) in a time dimension.
