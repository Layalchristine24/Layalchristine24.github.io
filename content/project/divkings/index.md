## Concept of the project

The goal of divkings is to give access to user-friendly tools to select
the companies which increase the size of their dividend. Some are called
*dividend kings* or *dividend aristocrats* because their dividends have
raised continuously over the past 50 and 25 years respectively and they
belong to the [S&P 500
index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp).

## Objective

The final objective of this project is to give a new tool to the people
who are starting to invest in the stock market and want to focus on .
