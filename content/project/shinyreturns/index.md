# Simulation of returns on project investments in the stock market
---

## Concept of the project
My project is to give access to user-friendly tools for computing the final 
value of an investment project.

## Shiny App
I intend to develop stock-trading tools which can be more user-friendly in a Shiny App. 

## Objective
The final objective of this project is to give a new tool to the people 
who are starting to invest in the stock market.

This is a new project, so please stay tuned !
