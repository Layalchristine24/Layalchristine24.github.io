# Testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register
---


This R package aims to test the estimation power of some classification methods which are applied to the arbitrarily clustered Swiss pension register. By doing this, it will be possible to discriminate between several methods in order to evaluate the feasibility of estimating the annual average determinant revenue (AADR) only with some sociodemographic characteristics.
