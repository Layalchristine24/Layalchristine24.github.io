# Testing classification methods on the Swiss Pension Register
---


This R package aims to test the estimation power of some classification methods which were applied to the Swiss pension register. By doing this, it will be possible to discriminate between several methods in order to evaluate the feasibility of estimating the annual average determinant revenue (AADR) only with some sociodemographic characteristics, which then enables us to estimate the corresponding OASI rents amounts.
