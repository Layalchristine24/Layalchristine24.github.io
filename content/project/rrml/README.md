# Machine learning of the Swiss Pension Register
Several classification methods are applied to the kamila-clustered Swiss Pension Register.
For the moment, only the linear discriminant analysis is applied and is still work-in-progress.
I intend to apply on the pension register the following methods: 
- Logit Discriminant Analysis, 
- Splines, 
- MARS, 
- Classification trees 
- and Transformation forests.
