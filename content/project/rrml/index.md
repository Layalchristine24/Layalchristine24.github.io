# Analysis of stocks
---

## Concept of the project
My new project is about analysing stocks in order to be able to compare
faster which companies can be trusted or not from a long-term point of view.

We intend to develop indicators which can be more user-friendly in a Shiny App.

This is a new project, so please stay tuned !
