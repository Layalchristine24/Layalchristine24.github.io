# Analysis of stocks
---

## Concept of the project
My new project is about analysing stocks in order to be able to compare
faster which companies can be trusted or not from a long-term point of view.

## Shiny App
We intend to develop indicators which can be more user-friendly in a Shiny App. 

## Objective
The final objective of this project is to give a new tool to the people 
who are starting to invest in the stock market.

This is a new project, so please stay tuned !
