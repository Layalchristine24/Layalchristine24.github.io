## Concept of the project
My project is about simulating several investment projects based on several assumptions and about computing the respective expected return on investment.

## Dependencies
This simulator is featured in a [Shiny App](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/shinyreturns) which makes easier to use
the simulator.

## Objective
The final objective of this project is to give a new tool to the people 
who are starting to invest.

This is a new project, so please stay tuned !
